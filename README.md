# Bond
Vue.js and lot of tool for a Solid POD

### HOWTO use Bond with Solid Platform ?

Just create a folder on a SOLID POD and put the desired index.html file at the root of that folder

example for a TODO app, just copy the index.html file that you find in solid/todo folder to a folder of your POD . [DEMO](https://cdr.solidcommunity.net/public/vuejs/todo/)

ps: You can do the copy with [poPock](https://scenaristeur.github.io/solid-vue-panes/editor)

Feel free to customize a css according to your needs

### Building
(TODO)
- publish ``` npm run git -- "message" ```

the idea is to use ```npm run git ``` command to build & publish tools like /todo/dist
- or vuejs components
